# Call for Proposals

From molecular sequencers to astronomical observatories, scientists have generated rich data about the world around us. At human scales, internet and social media data has shaped our day-to-day lives. All of these developments have taken place in the span of a few short decades, and the pace of data generation only seems to accelerate. In spite of the pervasiveness of data, questions around it tend to be framed more narrowly, with an emphasis on its mathematical or computational aspects. However, recent years have seen a paradigm shift in our perception of data, as reflected in projects such as The Art of Data in the Museum of the City of New York and the Rand Art + Data initiative. In addition to being a collection of measurements of our universe, data is now also perceived as an artistic entity with a human dimension, one that elicits intellectual and emotional responses. 

In this exhibition, we invite submissions from artists (professional or amateurs) and scientists alike. Submissions must focus on the perception of data from an artistic lens. We welcome artwork that 1) elicit aesthetic or emotional responses through beautiful representations of data, or 2) encourage reflection on the role of data in science, society and our daily lives. Selected artists will receive a $50 gift card for the work they create.

## Proposal Submission
Artists and scientists are encouraged to propose artworks related to the theme of data in science and society. Proposals for artwork in any medium will be considered. Your proposal should include the following,
- Description: What do you imagine for your final artwork, and how does it relate to the exhibition's theme?
- Media and requirements: What are your proposed artistic mediums (i.e., paint, print, ceramics, digital, wood, etc.) and dimensions? Will your artwork require a specific configuration of the exhibition space?
- Preliminary work: If you have them, you may include sketches, designs, or links to videos that represent your artistic vision.
- Portfolios of past work are welcomed and encouraged. 
- Proposals are limited to 2000 words and will be reviewed by the organizing committee. The dimensions of proposed artwork will be limited to 6’ x 6’ x 6’.

## Exhibition Details
If accepted, your artwork will be exhibited in the Hub Central Exhibit space in the west end of the Town Center (first floor) of the Discovery Building. This space is home to the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery's Hubs. Hanging 2D and occasionally 3D artwork rotates on exhibit in this space. The Discovery Building receives more than 50,000 visitors annually, thus making it a wonderful platform to display art.
